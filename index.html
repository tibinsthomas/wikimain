								Combe Hill is a causewayed enclosure, near
								Eastbourne in East Sussex, on the northern edge
								of the South Downs. It consists of an inner
								circuit of ditch and bank, incomplete where it
								meets a steep slope on its north side, and the
								remains of an outer circuit. Causewayed
								enclosures were built in England from shortly
								before 3700 BC until at least 3500 BC; their
								purpose is not known. The enclosure has been
								excavated twice: in 1949, by Reginald Musson;
								and in 1962, by Veronica Seton-Williams, who
								used it as a training opportunity for
								volunteers. Charcoal fragments from Musson's dig
								were later dated to between 3500 and 3300 BC.
								Musson also found a large quantity of Ebbsfleet
								ware pottery in one of the ditches.
								Seton-Williams found three polished stone axes
								deposited in another ditch, perhaps not long
								after it had been dug. The site is only 800
								metres (870 yd) from Butts Brow, another
								Neolithic enclosure; both sites may have seen
								Neolithic activity at the same time. (Full
								article...)
